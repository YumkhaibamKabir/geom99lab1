    <h1>Landmark Pursuit Expedition</h1>
    <h2>1.Assam State Zoo cum Botanical Garden,Guwahati.</h2>
    <p>The Assam State Zoo cum Botanical Garden (popularly known as Guwahati Zoo) is the largest of its kind in the North East region and it is spread across 432 acre (175 hectare). The zoo is located within the Hengrabari Reserved Forest at Guwahati, India. The zoo is home to about more than 1125 numbers of animals, birds and reptiles representing over 115 species of animals and birds from around the world.</p> <!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>2.Victoria Memorial,Kolkata.</h2>
    <p>The Victoria Memorial is a large marble monument dedicated to Queen Victoria, the Empress of India (1876-1901) facing the Queens Way on the Maidan in Central Kolkata. It was built between 1906 and 1921 by the British Raj.It is the largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the world. It stands at 64 acres of gardens and is now a museum under the control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.Possessing prominent features of the Indo-Saracenic architecture, it has evolved into one of the most popular attractions in the city.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>3.Indira Gandhi Planetarium,Lucknow.</h2>
    <p>Indira Gandhi Planetarium is tucked amidst anonymous concrete residential high rises, near the Gomti River that zigzags through downtown Lucknow, India. At first sight, the building seems to resemble an UFO that has crash landed on the way to the galaxy far far away—but as you look closer you’ll see it’s built in the shape of Saturn, surrounded by its distinguished rings.The 21-meter (69-foot) diameter spherical building is one of the biggest planetariums in Asia. It is named for Indira Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India, and opened to the public in 2003. Water surrounds the building and lights from below make it look like it is floating in space. When the planetarium first opened, their Japanese projector was the most advanced in the market. But now, the thick layer of the dust covering the machinery and the outdated desktop computer in the operator’s booth indicate that the operation is in need of an upgrade.There is a small and informative exhibition on the planetarium’s ground floor. It shows a variety of dioramas, including one featuring NASA’s Mars Pathfinder mission, with a replica of the Sojourner rover that moves on a fake Martian surface. There are also models of Indian-built rockets and a figure of Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut, wearing a spacesuit. In addition to the main building, the planetarium also has three mobile units. They travel regularly to countryside schools and fairs with inflatable domes and projector to educate kids on the importance of the space exploration and science.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>4.Red Fort,New Delhi.</h2>
    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in the Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persian palace architecture with Indian traditions.The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public Address System of Indian Army Corps of Signals.The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>5.Hawa Mahal,Jaipur.</h2>
    <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>6.Statue of Unity,Gujarat.</h2>
    <p>The statue has been built as an ode to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of independent India. He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states of the country to build the Republic of India.October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet aprox.) statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s welfare first. The Statue of Unity overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of the Narmada River and the sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the mainland to the statue.As a part of an outreach programme for the project, the state government had asked Indian farmers to donate their used farming equipment to collect iron needed for the statue of Sardar Patel. Eventually, about 5000 tonnes of iron is believed to be collected. Details of the construction and history of the leader can be seen in an in-house museum, inside the statue.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
    <h2>7.Jog Waterfall,Karnataka.</h2>
    <p>Jog Falls is a waterfall on the Sharavati river located in Sagara taluk, Shivamogga District and its view point located in Shimoga district of Karnataka, India. It is the second highest plunge waterfall in India. It is a segmented waterfall which depends on rain and season to become a plunge waterfall. The falls are major attractions for tourists and is ranked 36th in the list of free-falling waterfalls, 490th in the world by list of waterfalls by total height, 128th in the list of single-drop waterfalls in the World by the waterfall database.</p><!-- sources: Wikipedia-->
